# Async Framework Test

This is a proof of concept for a 'framework' that allows fire and forget async execution of code without job scheduling or creating new processes.

It does this by allowing you to send a response without stopping the flow of execution.

Wanna know how it works? Just start in main.php and follow the flow.

The interfaces are documented with further detail.
